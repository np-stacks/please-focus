# Please Focus
An upcoming browser extension that allows users to forcefully block unwanted pages, to maximize productivity. This extension doesn't gaurantee higher productivity; the user needs to do their part too!

## How does it work?
This extension allows users to set specific sites to set a time limit to, or completely block (or they can block all sites except for some). When users feel like they were productive, they can claim points (or they can set it to auto-reward mode), and then they can spend the points to extend the time limit or temporarily unblock a website.

There are multiple modes: `Disabled`, `Focus`, `Strict`, `Jail`, with Jail being the strictest and disabled being useless.
- **Disabled**: I don't know what this does to be honest.
- **Focus**: Regular Mode; some sites are blocked, but can be unlocked with points.
- **Strict**: Stricter; some sites are blocked, and cannot be unlocked with points.
- **Please**: Strictest; some sites are blocked, and the timer option is disabled. You will not be able to spend points.
